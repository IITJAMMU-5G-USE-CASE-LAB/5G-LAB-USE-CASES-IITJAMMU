# 5G-LAB-USE-CASES-IITJAMMU
Repository for 5G Use Case Lab at IIT Jammu — includes project documentation, datasets, workflows, processing scripts, and research outputs.

The 5G Use Case Lab at IIT Jammu is an initiative focused on exploring real-world applications of next-generation communication systems, intelligent sensing, and data-driven technologies. The lab is designed to bridge the gap between advanced research and practical deployment by developing scalable, reliable, and impactful solutions using 5G and beyond technologies.

Our work centers on integrating high-speed connectivity with smart devices, edge computing, real-time analytics, and spatial-temporal data processing. The goal is to build use cases that demonstrate how advanced communication networks can transform industries such as surveillance, disaster management, smart campuses, autonomous systems, and remote monitoring.
