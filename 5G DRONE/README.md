Practical implementation of an MEC-based smart surveillance system deployed and tested on a 5G testbed. The system aims to detect human presence, identify intrusions, and monitor loitering behavior in real time. To achieve this, we employ two state-of-the-art deep learning models – InsightFace for intrusion detection and YOLOv8-Pose for loitering analysis. The models are deployed at the MEC of the 5G testbed to minimize latency with optimize inference efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can accurately detect and monitor individuals within a few hundred milliseconds, validating the effectiveness of MEC-based deep learning deployment for real-time surveillance. Furthermore, we discuss key challenges, limitations, and lessons learned from our testbed-based implementation.
